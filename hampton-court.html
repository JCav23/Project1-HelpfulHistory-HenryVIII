                    <h2>Hampton Court Palace</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hampton Court Palace originally destined for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, chief minister to Henry VIII, began construction in 1514. When Wolsey fell out of favour with the king, the palace was given back to the king as Wolsey attempted to return to the king's good graces. It went on to become one of the king's most favoured residences where many important events occured within his life. It's where his son Edward VI was born, and mother to the child, Henry's third wife Jane Seymour died a few weeks later.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shortly after taking ownership of the palace the king began extensive rebuilding and expansion. His court consisted of over a thousand people and although the king owned over sixty houses and palaces few were large enough to house the entire assembly. As such one of the first of his many building works was to build the vast kitchens within the palace.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The Palace is now maintained by Historical Royal Palaces, an independant charity that manage some of the UK's unoccupied royal palaces. It is now a major tourist attraction and below you will see the map location of the palace in the London Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames.
