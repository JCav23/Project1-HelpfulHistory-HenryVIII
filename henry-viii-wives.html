            <h1>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</h1>
            <p><strong>Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived</strong> Most British school children were taught this rhyme while learning about Henry VIII. While he ruled England for 36 years he is best known for his six wives. It was his turbulent love life, quest for political unification and his desperant want of a male heir than led to the annullment of two of his marriages, and the execution of two others. In this section we will explore how his chaotic love life had a historical impact on England.</p>

                    <h2>Catherine of Aragon - "Divorced"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Married for 23 years, Catherine of Aragon was thought to have been the one woman he ever truly loved. Following his ascention to the throne in 1509 at the age of 17, Henry married Catherine and began to obsess over continuing the Tudor line. After several failed pregnancies, the pair gave birth to their daughter Mary in February 1516, she would be their only surviving child.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After several attempts Henry became frustrated at his lack of a male heir and his eyes began to wander, and by the 1520s he was drawn to one of Catherine's ladies in waiting. This led him to request the pope for an annulment of his current marriage which was ultimately refused. As such Henry divorced Catherine against the will of the Catholic Church and established the Church of England. So who was the woman that sparked the English Reformation...?</p>

                    <h2>Anne Boleyn - "Beheaded" </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Anne and her sister Mary spent several of their childhood years in France, but on their return to England sometime around 1520, Mary ended up having a short lived affair with Henry. Following this he became smitten with Anne, however with no interest in becoming a mistress she spurned the kings advances. It was at this point the king made his request to the pope to anull his marriage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Rome refused the anullment Henry broke away from the Catholic Church and formed the Church of England. He and Anne then wed in 1533 and Anne gave birth to their first child Elizabeth that year. Initially hopeful that Anne would provide him a male heir, he lost interest in her after a series of stillborn births. Eventually driven by his desire to be rid of the relationship he accused Anne of adultery and treason which led to her execution.</p>
