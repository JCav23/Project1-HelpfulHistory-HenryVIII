            <h1>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</h1>
            <p><strong>Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived</strong> Most British school children were taught this rhyme while learning about Henry VIII. While he ruled England for 36 years he is best known for his six wives. It was his turbulent love life, quest for political unification and his desperate want of a male heir that led to the annulment of two of his marriages, and the execution of two others. In this section we will explore how his chaotic love life had a historical impact on England.</p>

                    <h2>Catherine of Aragon - "Divorced"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Married for 23 years, Catherine of Aragon was thought to have been the one woman he ever truly loved. Following his ascension to the throne in 1509 at the age of 17, Henry married Catherine and began to obsess over continuing the Tudor line. After several failed pregnancies, Catherine gave birth to their daughter Mary in February 1516. She would be their only surviving child.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After several attempts Henry became frustrated at his lack of a male heir and his eyes began to wander, and by the 1520s he was drawn to one of Catherine's ladies in waiting. This led him to request the Pope for an annulment of his current marriage, which was ultimately refused. As such, Henry divorced Catherine against the will of the Catholic Church and established the Church of England. So who was the woman that sparked the English Reformation...?</p>

                    <h2>Anne Boleyn - "Beheaded" </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Anne and her sister Mary spent several of their childhood years in France, but on their return to England, sometime around 1520, Mary ended up having a short lived affair with Henry. Following this he became smitten with Anne, however, with no interest in becoming a mistress, she spurned the king's advances. It was at this point the king made his request to the Pope to annul his marriage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Rome refused the annulment Henry broke away from the Catholic Church and formed the Church of England. He and Anne then wed in 1533 and Anne gave birth to their first child Elizabeth that year. Initially hopeful that Anne would provide him a male heir, he lost interest in her after a series of stillborn births. Eventually driven by his desire to be rid of the relationship he accused Anne of adultery and treason, which led to her execution.</p>

                    <h2>Jane Seymour - "Died"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mere days after his previous wife's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour who had served as lady-in-waiting to both Anne Boleyn and Catherine of Aragon. Jane and Anne's mothers had been cousins and shared a grandmother and were raised together for a short time. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Jane gave birth to Edward VI, he would be the king's only surviving son, only living until 1553, when he died at the age of 15. Several weeks after the birth Jane suffered from complications, which took her life. She was laid to rest in St. George's Chapel at the request of the king where he is buried beside her.</p>

                    <h2>Anne of Cleves - "Divorced"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following the death of his previous wife, Henry remained a bachelor for two years. His next marriage came about following a suggestion from his chief minister. It was recommended that he seek an alliance with Europe and should marry one of the two sisters of Germany's Duke of Cleves (Anne and Amelia).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After he requested the portraits of the two women he decided to marry Anne, believing her to be the more pleasing of the two. However, when she arrived in England in 1540, Henry claimed she looked nothing like her depiction and tried to halt the wedding. However, he was unsuccessful and married Anne for six months before he divorced her with a generous settlement, and she was left to live in peace until her death in 1557.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Catherine Howard who had been lady-in-waiting to Anne of Cleves, married Henry in 1540 while she was between the age of 17 and 19. By this point in his life Henry had become very overweight and left unable to walk. He was said to be overjoyed with his new bride who he refered to as his "rose without a thorn".</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>He showered Catherine with gifts, until rumous of infidelity began to arise less than a year into their marriage. There was believed to have been enough evidence to show that she had been at the very least promiscuous, and was executed for adultery and treason in 1542.</p>

                    <h2>Catherine Parr - "Survived"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p>In July 1543 Henry married his sixth and final wife, Catherine Parr, an educated and spirited widow. Although she was arrested after showing an interest in Protestantism, she managed to avoid the same fate as some of the unlucky few of her predecessors. She went on to bring peace and stability to court, while serving as stepmother to Henry's children.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It has been said that of all of the wives of Henry VIII, Catherine had a strong influence over a variety of areas including reglion, the role of women, the culture at court and the education of Henry's children. It was her that persuaded Henry to restore his daughters Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession and acted as Regent while Henry was at war with France. She died in 1548 a year after the king.</p>
